# Infotecs

## Installation

Make sure that you have docker, docker-compose installed.

Clone repository and move to directory with docker-compose.yml file.

Then use command:
<pre><code> docker-compose up --build
</code></pre>

Now you have fully prepared project with initial seeds.

## Credentials
All credentials should be in '.env' file, but this file mustn't be presented in git repository.
At least '.env.example' may be here, but it's test exercise, and I added original file to save some time for you.
